    "In the following section we will be coverin modules. Above, we leaned about functions and the power that they have. Modules let us use functions that other people have created to solve problems that we commonly incounter. For example, if we find that we frequently have to create a function that adds together all of the numbers in a list, instead of coding it every time, you could just import a function that either you or someone else created in the past. Basically, modules and importing lets us have access to the work of every other coder, making it a very powerful tool."
